# OpenImages

OpenImages is a large set of image assets for computer vision, artificial intelligence, personal projects and commercial use. The images are completely free to use and do not require permission to use, modify or distribute.

## Usage

Download the repository as a zip or clone it with git. The images are in the `images` folder and categorized by type of images for example `nature > leaves > pine`.

## License

All content in this repository are free to use and do not require permission to use, modify or distribute. Attribution is not required but appreciated. Images can also be commercially used without permission or charge.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please open an issue or a pull request with the following requirements:
- None of the images should be copyrighted or have any restrictions on use.
- No adult content.
- All the images should be in the `images` folder and categorized by type.
- No faces or people in the images that have not given permission to be used.
- No advertising or logos in the images that might be copyrighted.
- Most of the images have a square aspect ratio, but it is not a requirement.
- Images should not have any motion or blur on them unless it is background blur and the subject is in focus.
- Images should be of high quality preferably more than 1000x1000 pixels.
- Images should be in a readable format like jpg (or JPEG) and png. Images that are not in these formats should be converted to one of these formats.
- Colour space should be RGB, sRGB, or Display P3. Using odd colour spaces can make it confusing for users to use the images on some software.
- No watermarks or text on the images unless it is part of the image like a sign.
- No artifacts or glitches in the images.
- See the good examples folder for examples of good images and follow the same guidelines.
- Images should not also be edited or have filters applied to them. The images should be as natural as possible. Rotating a photo is fine but no other edits, in short if the image looks bad or needs editing, it should not be included in the repository.
- Images cannot be AI generated or computer generated. They should be real photos taken by a camera or a phone.

If these requirements are not met, the pull request may be rejected.
